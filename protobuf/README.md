# Introduction to Protocol Buffers

This tutorial provides a basic Go programmer's introduction to working with **[protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)**, using the **[proto3](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3)** version of the protocol buffers language. By walking through creating a simple example application, it shows you how to:

- Define message formats in a .proto file.
- Use the protocol buffer compiler.
- Use the Go protocol buffer API to write and read messages.

## Description

The example we're going to use is a very simple "address book" application that can read and write people's contact details to and from a file. Each person in the address book has a name, an ID, an email address, and a contact phone number.

How do you serialize and retrieve structured data like this? There are a few ways to solve this problem:

- Use **[gobs](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/gob/)** to serialize Go data structures. This is a good solution in a Go-specific environment, but it doesn't work well if you need to share data with applications written for other platforms.
- You can invent an ad-hoc way to encode the data items into a single string â€“ such as encoding 4 ints as "12:3:-23:67". This is a simple and flexible approach, although it does require writing one-off encoding and parsing code, and the parsing imposes a small run-time cost. This works best for encoding very simple data.
- Serialize the data to XML. This approach can be very attractive since XML is (sort of) human readable and there are binding libraries for lots of languages. This can be a good choice if you want to share data with other applications/projects. However, XML is notoriously space intensive, and encoding/decoding it can impose a huge performance penalty on applications. Also, navigating an XML DOM tree is considerably more complicated than navigating simple fields in a class normally would be.
Protocol buffers are the flexible, efficient, automated solution to solve exactly this problem. With protocol buffers, you write a .proto description of the data structure you wish to store. From that, the protocol buffer compiler creates a class that implements automatic encoding and parsing of the protocol buffer data with an efficient binary format. The generated class provides getters and setters for the fields that make up a protocol buffer and takes care of the details of reading and writing the protocol buffer as a unit. Importantly, the protocol buffer format supports the idea of extending the format over time in such a way that the code can still read data encoded with the old format.

### Project Structure

- *schema* contains .proto file which defines our messages
- *adb* contains the generated .go file using defined schema
- *cmd* contains main.go file which utilizes file from *adb*

### Run Commands

- [Compiling your protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/gotutorial#compiling-your-protocol-buffers)
- go build -o addressbook.exe cmd/main.go
- addressbook list (to display all entries made into address book)
- addressbook add `[name of person]` (to create a new person entry in address book)

### Output

``` terminal
D:\godemo\protobuf>protoc -I=schema --go_out=. schema/addressbook.proto

D:\godemo\protobuf>go build -o addressbook.exe cmd/main.go
